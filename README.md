## Hands-On-Machine-Learning-Go-Beyond
The `Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow` is one of the first books on Machine Learning I have started reading.
This repository is a guide for everyone who wants to excel in Machine Learning.

I am reading the book currently, so let's grow together.

Machine Learning Checklist:
---
1. Frame the problem and look at the big piture
2. Get the data
3. Explore the data to gain insights
4. Prepare/Preprocess the data for machine leaning algorithms
5. Explore many different models and shortlist best ones
6. Fine-tune the models
7. Present the solution
8. Launch, monitor and maintain the system
